My Mininum Liquid Test Platform
===

Purpose
---

I *don't* know how to run Liquid as I *don't* know Ruby, so I just use
`jekyll new liquid` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run Liquid code.

Repo structure
---

I change the skeleton repo as *little* as possible.

- [ ] about page
- [ ] posts
- [ ] index page at root
- [x] layout for display
- [x] program code in include folder
- [ ] change gem dependency
